# Fetal_Health_Classification
Condition of the fetal during pregnancy is known as fetal health.
And classification of these conditions are known as fetal health classification.
To reduce the mortality rate during pregnancy and delivery, we needed fetal health classification.
The main reason is to classify the fetal health is: -
* To reduce mortality rate.
* To prevent complication.
* Early detection of Abnormality.
Goal of project is: -
(a)	Prepare a model which correctly classify the fetal health.
(b)	Find out the independent feature which highly influence the fetal health.


This is my first Project.
